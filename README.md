To run to the main search engine, run Retriever.py

There are three files that makes everything works:
  
  1.index.txt
  
  2.docidmap.txt
  
  3.offset.txt
  
If you wish to create a new index, run Indexer.py

It will create the three files along with following files:
  
  1.combined.txt
  
  2.Various chunk files (You will need a Chunks folder in the root of the project to place the offloaded indexes).
  
  
These files are used to keep track of the indexes offloaded and combined into the final index.

Retriever.py calculates the scores of the documments and ranks them.
